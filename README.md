## Play Sudoku

This is a sudoku app written in ReactJS. The code in this branch (reduxify) uses Redux for state management.

See the app in action on [Heroku](https://sudoku-react-app.herokuapp.com/). The code in the master branch is deployed.

The sudoku puzzles are generated via the node module "sudoku" created by Blagovest Dachev.
