## Play Sudoku

This is a sudoku app written in ReactJS. The code in the master branch is straight React, while the code in the reduxify branch has been modified to use Redux.

See the app in action on [Heroku](https://sudoku-react-app.herokuapp.com/). The code in the master branch is deployed.

The sudoku puzzles are generated via the node module "sudoku" created by Blagovest Dachev.
